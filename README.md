# MAGD-150-Projects

**This is a demonstration of what kind of projects were done during my introduction to Game Development Class at UW-W**

_Projects below:_
1. [Moving Shapes and Math](https://github.com/WaveryJames/MAGD-150-Projects/blob/master/s19magd150lab03_Walker/s19magd150lab03_Walker.pde)
  -This project was towards the beginning of the semester. We began looking at how processing understands movement. We also began to explore how math plays a role in how processing understands some coding language. The sketch itself is simply one shape that follows the mouse in a confinded space and a shape that moves back and forth on it's own.
