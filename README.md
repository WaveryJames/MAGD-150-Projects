# MAGD-150-Projects

**These are some project examples from my Introduction to Game Development Class at UW-W**

_Projects below:_
1. [Moving Shapes and Math](https://github.com/WaveryJames/MAGD-150-Projects/blob/master/s19magd150lab03_Walker/s19magd150lab03_Walker.pde)
  -This project was towards the beginning of the semester. We began looking at how processing understands movement. We also began to explore how math plays a role in how processing understands some coding language. The sketch itself is simply one shape that follows the mouse in a confinded space and a shape that moves back and forth on it's own.

2. [Intersections and User Input](https://github.com/WaveryJames/MAGD-150-Projects/blob/master/s19magd150lab05_Walker/s19magd150lab05_Walker.pde)
  -This project was geared toward understanding to code a sketch to react to user input, like buttons and hovering gradients. We also began to explore including text. The sketch itself is just a circle button that draws a box and within that box theres a button that adds some lines. 
  
  3.[Organization](https://github.com/WaveryJames/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/master/s19magd150lab06_Walker)
    -This project was delving deeping into the concept of orginization in processing. Things like classes, creating and calling our own created functions, and seperating which variables are most important. The sketch itself is just a circle that had rain pass through it.
    
  4.[Saving](https://github.com/WaveryJames/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/master/s19magd150lab08_Walker)
    -This project was looking at importing fonts, text files, and saving the enitrity of your sketch as a .pdf to use at a later time. My sketch that is linked is a motivational poster, where I utilized different colors, fonts, and colors. 
    
  5.[3-D](https://github.com/WaveryJames/MAGD-150-Projects/blob/master/s19magd150lab10_Walker/s19magd150lab10_Walker.pde)
    -This project is pretty self explainitory in the sense that we were looking at 3-D shapes and features of processing. We also tried to explore texturing and moving the POV camera within the sketch. My sketch itself is just as I described; 3-D shapes that are looking at with a camera you can move within the sketch. 
    
    
**When thinking about how complex coding sounds, these things are easy to pick up. I came from a background of no coding experience what-so-ever, and here I am creating a porfolio of all my creations. Thanks for reading and good luck coding!**
